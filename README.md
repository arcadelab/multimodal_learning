# Multimodal learning

How to use this repository:
1) Extract optical flows from the video. To do this, run the video_preprocessing.py script.
2) Train a model by running the training.py script.
3) Evaluate the trained model and get different results including U-map plots, gesture classification, skill classification, task classification by running the  embeddings_cluster_explore.py script.
